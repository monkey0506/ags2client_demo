This project serves as an example of how to set up and build
a plugin using the ags2client interface. This demo is
intended to serve as an example of how to create non-
functional stubs for proprietary client plugins.

For more info, see the ags2client submodule.

************
UPDATE v1.1:
************

The demo has been updated to the latest version of the
ags2client interface as of this writing (v2.0). With the
release of the AGSGalaxy (GOG Galaxy) plugin and the updated
version of the AGSteamStub (Steam stub) plugin, this demo is
officially being deprecated and will not be further
maintained with updates to the ags2client interface. For an
up-to-date demo of how to use the latest version of the
interface, please review the source code for these projects
instead.
